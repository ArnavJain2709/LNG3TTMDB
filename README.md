# solidJS LightningJS 3 TMDB app

The final internship project I made during the summer of first year. A web app that can be deployed on TV, mobile devices, desktops and on the web. 
Was deployed on Samsung TV for testing. Overall the app displays the trending shows and movies with their details pages and a search option as well.

## Quick Start

```sh
> npx degit lightning-js/solid-starter-template my-app
> cd my-app
> npm i # or yarn or pnpm
> npm start # or yarn or pnpm
```
